## Instructions for Adding the House Party Protocol Image

The README currently has a placeholder image at line 3. You need to replace it with an actual Iron Man 3 House Party Protocol image.

### Recommended Sources:

1. **DeviantArt Fan Art**:
   - URL: https://www.deviantart.com/billycsk/art/IRONMAN-3-a-part-of-house-party-protocol-476668361
   - Download the image and upload to repository

2. **Create an `images` folder**:
   ```bash
   mkdir images
   ```

3. **Download an image** from one of these sources:
   - Google Images: Search "Iron Man 3 House Party Protocol"
   - Movie screenshots from the final battle scene
   - Fan art (with proper attribution)

4. **Upload to repository**:
   ```bash
   mv downloaded-image.jpg images/house-party-protocol.jpg
   ```

5. **Update README.md line 3**:

   Replace:
   ```markdown
   ![House Party Protocol](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/1a1a1a/00ff00?text=House+Party+Protocol+-+Add+Iron+Man+3+Image+Here)
   ```

   With:
   ```markdown
   ![House Party Protocol](images/house-party-protocol.jpg)
   ```

### Scene to Capture:

Look for images from the final battle scene in Iron Man 3 where:
- Multiple Iron Man suits are flying in formation
- Tony Stark activates all his suits at once
- The suits emerging from the wreckage
- The iconic "House Party Protocol" activation moment

### Image Requirements:

- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Resolution**: At least 800x400 pixels (wider banner style preferred)
- **Quality**: High-resolution for professional appearance
- **Content**: Should show multiple Iron Man suits (representing the "legion" concept)

### Alternative:

If you can't find a good screenshot, consider:
- Creating a simple banner with Iron Man theme in Photoshop/GIMP
- Using official Marvel promotional images (with fair use considerations)
- Commissioning or creating original artwork

**Delete this file once the image is added to the repository.**
